    <p>Hi, I'm
    <span class="hiddentxt"><a>Alice</a></span>.
    <span class="hiddenimg"><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/eadbcabb-3737-4d30-8873-02b356841d86%2Fgiphy-1-website.gif?v=1571687801565" width="250"></span>
    </p>
    
    <p>I work with technological objects, 

    <span class="hiddentxt"><a>film (35mm)</a></span>, 
    <span class="hiddenimg"><img src="/assets/fivethousand-IG1.png" width="250"></span>

    and (sometimes) clay.

    <p>Most recently, I was at Capital One building a data-as-a-service platform. Less recently, I was a product manager for the ComiXology mobile app and library.

   <p>I studied
    <span class="hiddentxt"><a>the intersection of design, technnology, and philosophy</a> at NYU Gallatin</span>.
    <span class="hiddenimg">
      <a>My concentration applied affect theory as a lens to examine the relationship between humans and technology and its "irreducible <em>alterity</em>... in and through its active <em>connection</em> to the human and vice versa." <em>(Massumi, Parables for the Virtual)</em>
      <br><br>Yes, I grew up with a Tamagotchi pet (that I lovingly nurtured into a Mametchi).</a>
    </span>
    </p>

    <p>My personal creative work continues to explore the transmission of affect in built environments. 

    <p>A short essay I wrote on mythology, AI , and desire was published in print for <a href="https://www.clog-online.com/products/clog-x-artificial-intelligence">CLOG's Artifical Intelligence issue</a>.</p>

    <p>I collect print ephemera and try to maintain a ghostlike presence online.
    <p></p>
    

  <p>Take care, and <span class="hiddentxt"><a>see you soon IRL</a></span>!
