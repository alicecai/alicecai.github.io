Currently reading between the lines at [NYU Gallatin](https://gallatin.nyu.edu), dabbling in the studio arts, and petting feral cats. Sometimes all at once. 

I maintain a ghostlike presence on [twitter](https://twitter.com/linesforthefort) and [instagram](https://instagram.com/linesforthefort). My side project involves asking people what they [reread](http://rereadthis.com).
